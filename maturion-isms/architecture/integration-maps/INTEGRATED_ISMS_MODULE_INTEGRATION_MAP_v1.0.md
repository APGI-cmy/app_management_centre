Maturion Integrated Security Management System (ISMS)
Module Integration Map — Architecture + Workflow
Version 1.0

❇️ 0. PURPOSE

This document defines the master integration blueprint for the entire Maturion ISMS ecosystem.

It contains both:

Hub-and-Spoke Architecture Map
(Enterprise structural integration of modules)

Linear End-to-End Workflow Map
(Operational process and navigation flow)

This map is the master reference for:

Foreman build orchestration

Multi-agent development

Module boundaries & dependencies

Data governance and RLS

UI routing architecture

API and edge-function interfaces

Change-control

Integration QA

Training & onboarding

Every module (Threat, Vulnerability, RA, WRAC, Controls, PIT, Remote Assurance, Bowtie, Incident/Intel, etc.) connects to this master map.

🌐 1. HUB-AND-SPOKE ARCHITECTURE MAP

“ISMS Core as the Central Risk Brain”

This is the enterprise system-wide structural integration map.

🔄 2.3 Continuous Intelligence Feedback Loops
Threat drift → triggers vulnerability rechecks
Incident signals → adjust threat relevance
Remote assurance failures → increase risk values
CCR failures → increase live risk
PIT delays → reduce projected mitigation
New controls → reduce residual
Bowtie analysis → reprioritise PUE risks

All loops update:

WRAC

RA Engine

Strategy

Dashboards

Continuously.

📡 3. DATA FLOW MAP (System-to-System Interfaces)
Threat Module
    ↓ threats, TTP, drift
Vulnerability Module
    ↓ vulnerabilities, severity
Risk Assessment Engine
    ↓ inherent/residual/projected values, ALE
WRAC
    ↓ strategy, ROI, prioritisation
Controls Module
    ↔ control efficacy, CCR, performance
PIT
    ↔ implementation progress, audit logs
Remote Assurance
    ↔ system availability, manual/auto checks
Incident & Intelligence
    ↓ anomaly indicators → threat drift
Dashboarding Layer
    ↓ reporting
Maturity Module
    ↑ evidence collection

🔐 4. GOVERNANCE & SIGN-OFF FLOW
Custodian → Risk Owner → Senior Risk Owner → ExCo

This becomes your core navigation architecture.

🧱 6. MODULE INTEGRATION – AUTHORITY MODEL

Defines what each module is “the single source of truth” for, preventing overlap.

I will include this in the next version if needed.
